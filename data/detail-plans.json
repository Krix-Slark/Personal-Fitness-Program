Hydration: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.\n\n4. Rest: Ensure you get adequate rest between sets and exercises to allow muscle recovery.\n\n5.

      "tips": "1. Warm-Up and Cool Down: Always start with a 5-10 minute warm-up to prepare your muscles and end with a cool-down to aid recovery.\n\n2. Static Stretching Exercises: After your workout, perform static stretches for each major muscle group—such as \n- chest doorway stretch, \n- shoulder cross-body stretch, \n- seated hamstring stretch, \n- standing quad stretch, and \n- seated back twist—to enhance flexibility and reduce muscle tension.\n\n3. Hydration: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.\n\n4. Rest: Ensure you get adequate rest between sets and exercises to allow muscle recovery.\n\n5. Nutrition: Fuel your body with a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to support your fitness goals."
